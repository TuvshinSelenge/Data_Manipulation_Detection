# Data Manipulation Detection

It is my interdisciplinary project to detect manipulation and also maybe to say how the data was manipulated.

For this problem, I am trying to tackle it from different perspectives.  I use for the detection part five different methods.

1. Z-Scores is the statistical approach and the code for this can be found in the app.py file.
2. Cellwise outlier detection for this approach I am using a R-Package created by Jakob Raymaekers and Peter J. Rousseeuw.
3. Isolation forest is used for anomaly detection implemented using sklearn.
4. Local outlier factor is also used by incorperating from sklearn.
